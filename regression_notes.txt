Although we often think of multiple regression as including multiple different features (e.g. # of bedrooms, square feet, and # of bathrooms) but we can also consider transformations of existing variables e.g. the log of the square feet or even "interaction" variables such as the product of bedrooms and bathrooms. Add 4 new variables in both your train_data and test_data.

‘bedrooms_squared’ = ‘bedrooms’*‘bedrooms’
‘bed_bath_rooms’ = ‘bedrooms’*‘bathrooms’
‘log_sqft_living’ = log(‘sqft_living’)
‘lat_plus_long’ = ‘lat’ + ‘long’
Before we continue let’s explain these new variables:

Squaring bedrooms will increase the separation between not many bedrooms (e.g. 1) and lots of bedrooms (e.g. 4) since 1^2 = 1 but 4^2 = 16. Consequently this variable will mostly affect houses with many bedrooms.
Bedrooms times bathrooms is what's called an "interaction" variable. It is large when both of them are large.
Taking the log of square feet has the effect of bringing large values closer together and spreading out small values.
